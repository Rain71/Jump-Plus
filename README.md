Project Title: Online Chocolate Shop Management System

Project Overview:

Design and implement a database system for an online chocolate shop. 
The system should handle various aspects of managing the shop, 
including inventory management, customers, orders and user authentication.

Skills Demonstrated:

Beginner:
•	Creating tables and defining relationships
•	Basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
•	Simple queries using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses
Intermediate:
•	Implementing constraints and indexes for data integrity and performance optimization
•	Utilizing JOIN operations for querying data from multiple tables
•	Aggregating data using GROUP BY and aggregate functions
•	Implementing views and stored procedures for modularizing queries and operations
Advanced:
•	Handling transactions for maintaining data consistency and integrity
•	Implementing complex queries involving subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions
•	Performance tuning using query optimization techniques like query plans and indexes
•	Implementing security measures such as roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive data

Project Components:

1.	Database Design:
  a.	Design the database schema, including tables for chocolate, customers, and orders
  b.	Define relationships between tables
  c.	Implement constraints for data integrity
2.	Data Population:
  a.	Populate the database with sample data for chocolate, customers, and orders
  b.	Ensure data consistency and referential integrity
3.	Basic Operations:
  a.	Implement CRUD operations for managing chocolate, customers, and orders
  b.	Allow users to add, update and delete records from the database
4.	Intermediate Queries:
  a.	Create queries to retrieve information such as:
    i.	Top-selling chocolate
    ii.	Customers with the highest order amounts
    iii.	Total revenue generated over a specific period
    iv.	Chocolate with low inventory levels
   b.	Utilize JOIN operations to fetch data from multiple related tables
6.	Advanced Features:
  a.	Implement transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency during order processing
  b.	Develop complex queries to answer specific business questions(e.g., identifying patterns in customer behavior)
  c.  Optimize query performance by analyzing query execution plans and indexing strategies
  d.	Implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data and operations
7.	Documentation and Presentation:
  a.	Document the database schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints
  b.	Provide explanations for the implemented features and query optimization techniques
